Only want free patterns?  Here are two other bracelets which are free: [Pineapple Wrist Cuff #2](/posts/pineapple-wrist-cuff-2/) and [Craft Bazaar Antique Lace](/posts/craft-bazaar-bracelet/).

While brainstorming new crochet cuff/bracelet ideas, I thought, why not use the classic pineapple pattern? I love crochet pineapples, but I never had a good use for them other than doilies, and, let’s face it, you can have too many doilies.

Pattern uses size 3 thread, and requires 3 buttons (pearl suggested). Size is adjusted by adding or subtracting the basic crochet stitches at the beginning and end of each row or by extending side borders at the end.

For troubleshooting or feedback, please contact me directly!

> Note:  Don’t skip the blocking!  It’s as simple as lightly steaming the work.  It takes less than one minute, and it will fix all those wavy/wobbly issues.  I promise!
