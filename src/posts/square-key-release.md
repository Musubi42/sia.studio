Another pattern release!  I'm on a roll now.  :)  Check out the photos for my newest design, the square key unisex scarf.  Unique Greek key motif on one side and stripes with texture on the other.  And one super-cute canine model.

Pattern can be found on both [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/210457515/square-key-unisex-scarf-crochet-pattern) and [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/square-key-unisex-scarf).  Cheers!
