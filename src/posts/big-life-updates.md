Sorry for the delay in writing... I've been preparing for a big move to New Orleans!  I will be working for a charter school management organization, helping to improve student achievement in the public schools (more good kharma stuff).

I'll try to get back to more crochet and travel writing soon, but in the meantime, check out my cute new home - a remodeled 1/2 shotgun - perfect for adding little crochet touches here and there:
