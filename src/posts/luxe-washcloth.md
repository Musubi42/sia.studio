I already released this pattern on Ravelry, but I wanted to post for those of you not on Ravelry.  This was my first washcloth pattern.  You can get the matching Bath Mitt pattern through [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/luxe-bath-collection-washcloth-and-bath-mitt) or [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/168959130/luxe-bath-collection-crochet-washcloth).  Enjoy!

Bring the spa home to your own bathroom with this luxurious organic cotton washcloth.  Everyone needs a little pampering, and this quick project, paired with the matching bath mitt (separate pattern) let you indulge before you can finish saying, ‚Äúyarn over, insert hook, yarn over, pull up a loop, yarn over, draw through two loops, yarn over, draw through last two loops.‚Äù  Well, maybe that‚Äôs a bit of an exaggeration, but they‚Äôre still quick and perfect for gift-giving, especially paired with a favorite bath shop gift card.  For troubleshooting or feedback, please contact me directly!

**NEW** You can now get patterns for this washcloth, the matching bath mitt, the Spa washcloth and bath mitt, AND the Vieux Carre towel in [one discounted pattern pack](https://www.etsy.com/listing/205361505/bath-collection-3-crochet-patterns-for).

**Yarn**:  I chose an organic cotton yarn, Blue Sky Alpacas Worsted Cotton, which is extra soft with a nice light sheen. Color A (Drift) uses about 54 yds (35 g) and Color B (Azul) uses about 12 yds (8 g). This yarn is a very thick worsted-weight cotton yarn; if you substitute for a regular worsted weight yarn, you may need to reduce hook size to maintain a thick and sturdy washcloth.

**Materials**:  Crochet hook size US H (5.0 mm), yarn needle (to weave in ends)

**Gauge & Sizing**: Gauge is not critical for the washcloth but if you choose to continue with the bath mitt pattern: 11 stitches and 8 rows = 4 inches square.  The finished size of the washcloth is 8.5 inches by 9.75 inches with the border. For a larger washcloth, you may increase the pattern width by 6 stitches and increase length by adding rows to the main body.

**Care instructions**: Make sure you include the yarn manufacturers care instructions when giving this as a gift. Washable yarns are best, and many suggest drying flat to maintain shape and extend lifetime.

**Abbreviations and Special Stitches**
- ch = Chain
- dc = Double crochet
- hdc = Half double crochet
- sc = Single crochet
- sl st = Slip stitch
- st = Stitch
- tr = Treble/triple crochet
- yo = Yarn over

Shell: This stitch is a modified shell stitch cluster. In stitch indicated 2 dc, ch 1, tr, ch 1, 2 dc all in one stitch. If you download the pdf on Ravelry, a chart diagram of the border is included.

Picot: This stitch is performed 3 times for each shell. To make a picot, sc in indicated stitch. Then, ch-4 somewhat taut, and join with a sl st to the sc just performed.  See my [Picot Tutorial post](/posts/picot-tutorial/) for more details or a refresher. Note that most other patterns use a ch-3 rather than a ch-4.

## Washcloth Pattern

**Main Body**

Beginning chain: In Color A, ch 27. To change width, add or subtract chains in multiples of 6.

Row 1: Hdc in third ch from hook (first 2 ch count as first st), *skip 1 ch, 2 hdc in next ch, repeat from * across except in last ch, hdc only once. Turn. (25 stitches total)

Row 2: Ch 2 (counts as first st), hdc in first st, *skip 1 st, 2 hdc in next st, repeat from * across except in last st (top of ch-2), hdc only once. Turn. (25 stitches total)

Rows 3-desired length: Repeat row 2 until washcloth height is about ¬Ω inch shorter than width. Change to Color B in last pull-through of last row and turn. Do not cut Color A.

Border Row 2: Sl st into first st, *skip 2 st, make shell in next st, skip 2 st, sl st in next st, repeat from * three times (to end of row). Cut and fasten off Color B.

Border Row 3: Pull up Color A from below, ch 1, sc in same st, *sc in next 2 st, make picot in top of ch-1, make picot in top of tr, make picot in top of ch-1, sc across next 3 st (be careful to not skip over the sl st in previous row), repeat from * three times except sl st in last st. Fasten off. Weave in loose ends well.
