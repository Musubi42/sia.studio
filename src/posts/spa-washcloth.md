I created yet another washcloth pattern, so here it is just in time for last-minute Christmas present making.  It's super fast and fairly easy. Let me know if you find any errors or need help troubleshooting! Please note that this pattern is copyrighted and thus for personal use only (do not sell pattern or products made from pattern). Thanks, and happy hooking (the legal kind)!! The matching bath mitt is available through [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/spa-bath-collection-washcloth-and-bath-mitt) or [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/168968769/spa-bath-collection-crochet-washcloth).

**NEW**: You can now get patterns for this washcloth, the matching bath mitt, the Luxe washcloth and bath mitt, AND the Vieux Carre towel in [one discounted pattern pack](https://www.etsy.com/listing/205361505/bath-collection-3-crochet-patterns-for).

**Yarn**:  I chose an organic cotton yarn, Blue Sky Alpacas Worsted Cotton, which is extra soft with a nice light sheen. Color A was Azul (628) and Color B was Drift (614). The washcloth uses about 85 yards total. This yarn is a very thick worsted-weight cotton yarn. If you substitute for a regular worsted-weight cotton yarn, you may need to reduce hook size to maintain a thick and sturdy washcloth.

**Materials**:  Crochet hook size US H (5.0 mm), yarn needle (to weave in ends)

**Gauge and Size**:  Gauge is not critical for this pattern, but if you are a gauge stickler, 11 stitches and 8 rows = 4 inches square using the washcloth body motif.  The finished size of the washcloth is 9.5 inches by 11 inches with the border.  To modify washcloth size, change width by adding or subtracting stitches in multiples of 4, and change length by adding or subtracting rows to the main body.

**Blocking**:  Blocking is not required (after all, it will be washed multiple times) but can add polish to your project if you are giving it as a gift.

**Care instructions**:  Make sure you include the yarn manufacturerâ€™s care instructions when giving this as a gift. Machine-washable yarns are best, and many suggest drying flat to maintain shape and extend lifetime.

**Abbreviations and Special Stitches**
- ch = Chain
- hdc = Half double crochet
- sc = Single crochet
- sc2tog = Single crochet 2 together
- sl st = Slip stitch
- st = Stitch
- yo = Yarn over

Puff: The border design uses an alternating series of puff stitches. To make the puff stitch, at indicated stitch, yo and pull up a loop 4 times, then pull through all loops on hook. To make a more muted puff (as shown in the mitt photo), only yo and pull up a loop 3 times.

Picot: Picots are used for the final border row. To make a picot, first sc in indicated stitch. Then, ch-3 and join with a sl st to the sc just performed. See my [Picot Tutorial post](/posts/picot-tutorial/) for more details or a refresher.

## Washcloth Pattern

**Main Body** ([watch tutorial video](https://youtu.be/7Aoqc2Mvtio) - for a mini-version of the washcloth)

Beginning chain: In Color A, ch 29. To change width, add or subtract chains in multiples of 4.

Row 1: Hdc in third ch from hook (first 2 ch count as first st), *skip 1 ch, 2 hdc in next ch, repeat from * across except in last ch, hdc only once. Turn. (27 stitches total)

Row 2: Ch 2 (counts as first st), hdc in first st, *skip 1 st, 2 hdc in next st, repeat from * across except in last st (top of ch-2), hdc only once. Turn. (27 stitches total)

Rows 3-desired length: Repeat row 2 until washcloth height is about Â½ inch shorter than width. Change to Color B in last pull-through of last row and turn. Cut loose Color A.

**Border** ([watch tutorial video](https://youtu.be/_JXV5Fv3mOI) - for mini version of washcloth)

Border Row 1: In Color B, ch 1, sc across except skip next to last st and sc in last st (ch-2 of previous row). This is necessary because the border motif is wider than the body motif. (26 stitches total). Turn.

Border Row 2: Ch 1, sc in same st, sc, *make puff, sc across next 3 st, repeat from * across. Turn

Border Row 3: Ch 1, make puff in same st, sc in next 3 st, *make puff, sc in next 3 st, repeat from * across except ending with only 1 sc after final puff.

Border Row 4: Repeat border row 2. Change to Color A in last pull-through, and cut Color B.

Border Row 5: Ch 1, make picot in same st, *sc in next st, make picot in next st, repeat from * across. For last picot, instead of making a normal sc at the base, sc2tog. Then, continue with ch-3 and sl-st to same sc. Before fastening off, make one final sl st to base st to make picot stand up properly (optional). Fasten off. Weave in loose ends well.

I would love to see your finished objects (post on Ravelry or in comments)!
