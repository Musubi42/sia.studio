**Note**:  Donâ€™t skip the blocking!  Itâ€™s as simple as lightly steaming the work.  It takes less than one minute, and it will fix all those wavy/wobbly issues.  I promise!

**Yarn**:  I used J&P Coats Royale Fashion Crochet (Size 3), less than one skein.

**Materials**:  Crochet hook size US C (2.5mm), small yarn needle to weave in ends and sew on buttons, buttons (3 or more).

**Gauge and size**:  Gauge is not critical as the size is adjusted by adding or subtracting side border rows.  Start by working the first two rows.  If the work is too small, you can continue.  If the cuff is already too large, then you will have to tighten your stitches either (smaller hook, smaller yarn).  My version after adding the border is a curved 6.5 inches at the wrist, and wider on the part further up the arm.  My wrist is about 6 inches in diameter.

**Abbreviations and Special Stitches**
ch = Chain sc = Single crochet
hdc = Half double crochet
dc = Double crochet
sl st = Slip stitch
st = Stitch
fan = 2 dc, 1 ch, 2 dc all in one stitch

**Row 11**:  Ch 1, sc in first st, *(ch 3, sc in next ch-1 space) all the way across.  Sc two more times in last st to create a corner and start the border on the sides and bottom.  Do not turn.

### Border

**Side 1**:  Rotate the work 90 degrees so that you can now continue crocheting sc evenly along this side edge.  When you get to the end, ch 1, turn, and crochet the next row.  The side might be uneven so use various stitches (sl st, sc, hdc, dc) to even out the height (i.e., in valleys use taller stitches and on hills use shorter stitches).  When you get to the end, turn, 2 sc, make a button hole (ch and skip stitches according to the size of your button), sc to middle, make a button hole, sc to almost the end, make another button hole, sc to end.  Add 2-3 more sc in last stitch to create a corner.  Do not turn.

**Bottom**:  Rotate the work 90 degrees so you can now continue crocheting sc evenly along this bottom edge.  Add 2-3 more sc in last stitch to create a corner.  Do not turn.

**Side 2**:  Rotate the work 90 degrees so that you can now continue crocheting sc evenly along this side edge.  When you get to the end, ch 1, turn, and crochet the next row.  The side might be uneven so use various stitches (sl st, sc, hdc, dc) to even out the height (i.e., in valleys use taller stitches and on hills use shorter stitches).  When you get to the end, turn, and continue adding rows until the cuff is large enough for your wrist.

**Fasten off**, leaving a long tail to sew the buttons on with.  Steam/lightly block before adding buttons.
