I'm back at it!  My friend is participating in her school's craft bazaar, so I was inspired to create a few new patterns.  For those of you who are looking for patterns you can use to earn a few bucks, feel free to use these for your own craft bazaars as long as you give my blog credit.

For these bracelets, I was inspired by the Blueprint Crochet [Julie Cuff](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/julie-cuff) that I made last year as a Christmas present - I thought why not make a whole series of these using crochet flowers and lace edgings?  Here is the pattern for my first lace crochet bracelet - I would love to see your interpretations!  Please let me know if you find any errors in the pattern.  I know a diagram a la Japanese crochet would be easier to follow, but hey it's a free pattern.

**Yarn and notions**:  I used  J&P Coats Fashion Crochet Thread (Royale), size 3.  Pearl button, about size 1/4 in.

**Materials**:  US size C (2.5 mm) crochet hook, and smaller yarn needle to weave in ends and join the button.

**Gauge and size**:  Gauge is not important for this pattern.  Measure the size of your wrist with measuring tape - make sure you stop slightly greater than half your wrist size from the center of your flower to the end of the strap you are making.  See pattern for details.

**Abbreviations** (American terms)
- ch = Chain
- dc = Double crochet
- sc = Single crochet
- sl st = Slip stitch
- sp = Space (as in a chain space)
- st = Stitch

## Pattern
**Flower and first strap**

Beginning chain:  Ch 4, join with a sl st to beginning ch.

Row 1:  *Ch 3, dc three times in ring, ch 3, sc in ring, repeat from * 3 more times to make 4 petals.  Do not turn.

Row 2:  *Ch 4, skip all stiches in petal, sc in top of sc (on the other side of the first petal), repeat from * 3 more times.  We just made 4 chain spaces that will be the base for the next row of petals.  Do not turn.

Row 3:  *Sc in next ch-4 space, ch 3, dc six times in same space, ch 3, sc in same space, repeat from * 3 more times to make 4 larger petals.  Do not turn.

Row 4:  Similar to Row 2, we will make base chains that we can then build our bracelet straps from.  These base chains will be attached on either side of the petals, and also in the middle of the petal, but on the back side of course.  *Ch 3, go behind the petal to sc in the middle of the ch sp from Row 2 (halfway through the 6 dc's), ch 3, sc between the 2 sc's on the other side of the petal, repeat from * 3 more times.  Do not turn.

Row 5:  Sc four times in next sp, *sc in next sp, ch 3, sc in same sp, ch 3, sc in next sp, ch 3, sc in same sp**.  Sc four times in next sp, sc four times in next sp.  Repeat from * to ** once, sc four times in final sp, sl st to beg sc.  Do not turn.

Row 6:  Sl st in next 4 sc, sl st to sp, ch 1, sc, *ch 3, sc in next sp, repeat from * once, sl st to next sc, TURN.

Row 7:  Ch 1, sc in next sc, * ch 3, sc in sp, repeat from * once, ch 3, sl st in last sc, TURN.

Row 8:  Sl st to sp, ch 1, sc in same sp, * ch 3, sc in next sp, repeat from * once, sl st to last sc, TURN.

Rows 9-12:  Repeat rows 7 and 8 two more times.

Row 13:  Sl st to sc, sl st to sp, ch 1, sc in sp, ch 3, sc in next sp, sl st to final sc, TURN.

Row 14:  Ch 1, sc in sc, sc in sp, ch 3, sc in same sp, sc in last sc, TURN.

Repeat row 14 until strap is a little more than half the diameter of your wrist when you measure it from the middle of the flower.

Fasten off, leaving a longer tail to join the button.  Join button not at the very tip, but about 1 row from the tip.

**Second strap**

With flower facing you and first strap hanging down, join thread/yarn on top of last sc before the spaces begin for the second strap.  Sl st to sp, ch 1, sc, *ch 3, sc in next sp, repeat from * once, sl st to next sc, TURN.

Repeat rows 7-14, and then repeat 14 until strap is long enough fit comfortably on your wrist when you use one of the existing lace holes to button it.

Fasten off, weave in ends.
