I just released the Andras man scarf pattern on both [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/177193047/andras-man-scarf-crochet-pattern) and [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/andras-man-scarf).  Here are the photos - and yes, that is my dad.  I wanted to make him a special Christmas present that was stylish and represented our culture.  I hope you enjoy it too!
