If you don't already know, we are in the midst of a sneaux-pacalypse in New Orleans.  Thanks to facebook, I discovered one activity to keep our household busy -  [Mutts Muggin](http://www.buzzfeed.com/chelseamarshall/21-mutts-muggin), or as I like to call it, Pups in Cups. Here is our attempt - it's much more difficult to achieve than it looks.  :)

Happy Sneaux Day!
