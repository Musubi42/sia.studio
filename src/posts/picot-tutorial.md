Since several of my patterns use picot stitches, I thought I would post my method for making picot stitches, which you can use for all of my patterns (some use different top chain lengths though).

## Step 1

![](/images/picot/step1.JPG "The first step is to make a sc in the stitch indicated.")

## Step 2

![](/images/picot/step2.JPG "Next, ch 3 (photo shows a ch-4 but most patterns use only a ch-3).")

## Step 3

![](/images/picot/step3.JPG "Attach to the sc just made by inserting hook in both the front loop and the left post of the sc.  See dotted lines in Step 2 photo as well as below.")

## Step 4

![](/images/picot/step4.JPG "Complete the sl st by yarning over and pulling a loop through all three loops on hook.")

## Post-picot

![](/images/picot/post.JPG "Continue with next stitch indicated in pattern.")

Happy Picoting!
