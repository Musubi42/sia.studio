Today I posted my first pattern for sale - in other words, for people to actually pay money for.  Imagine that!  It was a slow morning but I finally got my first sale - woo hoo!!  I love the pattern - it's a scarf I designed for my boyfriend since most of the scarf designs are... let's just say they aren't very manly.  And as for results - let's just say he loves it too.  I actually believe him since he puts it on first thing every morning (well, maybe the sweat pants come first).

The official blurb for the Jones Rustic Scarf is:

> This is the perfect boyfriend (or husband, grandpa, extramarital lover) scarf – no girly stitches here!  We’ve all spent hours working on projects for the special males in our life only to get a quizzical look in response which seems to say, “you expect me to wear a [insert one or more: lacy, bobble, shell stitch, pink] scarf?”  Alas, fret no more!  This textured scarf was designed with extra special input from a genuinely macho representative of the less fair sex.

We are all definitely grounded in reality here though - no getting rich off of this hobby.  However, maybe it will help pay for my yarn habit.  :)

You can purchase the pattern on [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/jones-rustic-scarf) or on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/168973505/mens-rustic-scarf-crochet-pattern-with).

I would love to hear your feedback or comments on my pattern!
