I had some leftover awesome-looking sari yarn and thought my phone looked cold even though I live in New Orleans. Alas, my creativity led me to do something about both problems at once.

**Yarn**:  I used Berocco Idol which is a variegated sari yarn.  It is theoretically bulky, but I found that it worked up more like an aran weight or heavy worsted weight yarn.  You can adjust the pattern to match your yarn weight (add/remove beginning chains and add/remove rows).

**Materials**:  Crochet hook size US H (5.0 mm) or appropriate size for your yarn, yarn needle (to weave in ends)

**Abbreviations and Special Stitches**
ch = Chain
dc = Double crochet
hdc = Half double crochet
sc = Single crochet
sc2tog = Single crochet 2 together
sl st = Slip stitch
st = Stitch

> **Note**:  Throughout pattern, the chains at the beginning of a row do not count as the first stitch.

## Main Body (worked in the round)
**Beginning chain**:  Ch 10.
**Row 1**:  Sc 2nd ch from hook and across (in back loops).  Sc 3 more times in last ch.  Rotate to work back across in the front loops to the beg ch.  Sc 2 more times in the beg ch. (Net stitches:  4 total sc in the beginning and ending ch, and 2 sc on either side of each of the other ch for 24 total sc). Sl st to top of beginning sc.
**Row 2**:  Ch 1, sc in same st and around, sl st to top of beg sc (24 sc).

> **After row 2, test the size of your cozy by inserting your phone.  If it is too big, start over with a smaller beg ch.  If it is too small, start over with a larger beg ch.**

**Row 3**:  Repeat row 2.
**Row 4**:  Ch 2, hdc in same st and around, sl st to top of beg hdc (24 hdc).
**Row 5**:  Repeat row 2.
**Row 6**:  Ch 3, dc in same st and around, sl st to top of beg dc (24 dc).
**Rows 7-14**:  Repeat rows 3-6 two times.
**Row 15**:  Repeat row 2.  Do not fasten off - continue with Flap row 1...

## Flap (worked flat)
**Flap row 1**:  Ch 1, sc in same st and next 9 st (10 sc).  Ch 2, turn.
**Flap row 2**:  Hdc across (10 hdc).  Ch 1, turn.
**Flap rows 3-6**:  Repeat rows 1-2 two times.
**Flap row 7**:  Sc across first 8 st then sc2tog in last 2 st (9 st).  Ch 1, turn.
**Flap row 8**:  Sc across first 7 st then sc2tog in last 2 st (8 st).  Ch 1, turn.
**Flap row 9**:  Sc across first 6 st then sc2tog in last 2 st (7 st).  Ch 1, turn.
**Flap row 10**:  Sc across first 5 st then sc2tog in last 2 st (6 st).  Ch 1, turn.
**Flap row 11**:  Sc across first 4 st then sc2tog in last 2 st (5 st).  Ch 1, turn.
**Flap row 12**:  Sc across first 3 st then sc2tog in last 2 st (4 st).  Ch 1, turn.
**Flap row 13**:  Sc across first 2 st then sc2tog in last 2 st (3 st).  Ch 1, turn.
**Flap row 14**:  Sc in first st then sc2tog (2 st).  Ch 1, turn.
**Flap row 15**:  Sc2tog.  Do not fasten off.  Make the wrap cord by chaining for about 1 yard.  Fasten off.  Keep end tail to tie off pom-pom.

## Pom-Pom

1. You may want to practice with junk yarn first.  Cut a piece of yarn at least 6 inches long and set aside.
2. Find an object whose circumference is a bit more than half of what you want the diameter of your pom-pom to be.  Wrap yarn around it many times (20+) and then cut the end.
3. Carefully slip all the yarn off the object and use the previously cut yarn length to tie tightly across the middle of the loops.  Knot one side then loop back and knot the other side too for insurance.
4. Now snip all the loops.  You will have a scraggly looking pom-pom like the one below:
5. Trim all the ends EXCEPT the ends of your knot yarn until you have a nice, even pom-pom.
6. Tie the knot yarn to the tail of your wrap cord then weave in/trim all ends.
