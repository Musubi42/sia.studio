Only after exposing my entire yarn stash to my boyfriend was I embarassed enough to finally do something about it.  First item on the list:  kill or finish the fugly sampler afghan.  Probably about 10 years ago when I was getting into crochet again (as an adult), I bought a pattern with one million squares of stitch samples (okay maybe it had a few less than one million but I like saying that while I put my pinky next to my mouth like Dr. Evil).  I also bought one billion yards of super ugly super cheap acrylic yarn (heretoforth to be referred to as SUSCAY) which I can't even stand to look at anymore - what was I thinking?  They don't even make that stuff anymore thank Zeus.  (No, Greeks are no longer pagan - I just wanted to mess with you).  The pattern has since been misplaced or lost but I already had 21.33 squares completed.  Despite the fugliness, I was self guilt-tripping at the thought of getting rid of it without piecing it together first.  Call me crazy if you like.

So, I pieced together a fugly afghan (now a fugly baby afghan since I only had 21.33 of the one million squares) despite my long to-do list and the fact that I really have no desire to keep it.  What the heck.  It grew on me.  Kind of like how super ugly dogs end up being cute.  I figure I can at least donate it to a womens' shelter so that my time would have been spent on good kharma stuff.  That makes me happy.  Seriously.  I'm all about the "making the world a better place" type of stuff.  The rest of the SUSCAY is going to Goodwill.  Maybe someone will like it.
