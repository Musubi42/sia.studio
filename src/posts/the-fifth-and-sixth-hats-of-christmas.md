(see my [intro post on my Twelve Hats of Christmas](/posts/the-12-hats-of-christmas/))

## For the Fifth Hat of Christmas I truly crocheted for me... more than 5 colorful rings...

I finally found a good use for my Noro Silk Garden - it's been sitting in my stash for over 3 years!

[Ravelry project notes](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/SiaTex/slanting-stitches-hat):  I modified the beginning chain to only 78 stitches. I also modified the last few rows (top of hat) to make it more oblong rather than circular (crocheted together in front and back area more than sides).

## For the Sixth Hat of Christmas I truly crocheted for me... one hat a laying...

I say "a laying" because this hat is a bit floppy so it takes some work to get the bill to sit properly.  I tried felting a bit, but got tired before it did much.

[Ravelry project notes](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/SiaTex/29-210-24-cap):  This is a really cute pattern. The smaller stitches made it take a bit longer, but it’s an easy pattern - basically just a bunch of double crochet and some single crochet.

This yarn is theoretically DK, but actually probably a bit thinner. It lays and drapes well, which I’m not sure is good for a hat pattern, but I like how it’s low-profile.

I added one more row of double crochet, but I don’t think it was necessary in hindsight.

I needed to block this a lot as it curls - I think more for the yarn and looser stitch. I need to re-block the brim a bit.

FYI, yarn amounts are only approximate. My battery died on my scale. I used 2 strands for the flower.
