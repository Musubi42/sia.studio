One great advantage of living in New Orleans and having all your relatives elsewhere is that you can make super easy and pretty cheap gift baskets with various New Orleans/Louisiana/Creole type products.  Here is a basket I made which is easily customizable with your own preferences:

I wrote "Joyeux Noel" on the tag as well as the English version, and attempted to draw a fleur de lis.  I also bought a few tea towels with "Gumbo" and "Bread Pudding" written on them, but that's just extras.  :)  Note:  I don't even use most of these products, but I wanted to give my family a good cross-section of the homemade food options.  Maybe some of you can use these ideas.  :)
