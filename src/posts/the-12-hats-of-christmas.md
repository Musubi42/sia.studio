As some of you may know, I'm an avid triathlete.  Well, was an avid triathlete.  You see, I did Ironman Texas in May and haven't quite gotten the itch to be "avid" since then.  In the meantime, I need another endurance sport to pursue, so I have chosen crochet hat-making.

While this may be no true marathon, it will probably take about 26.2 hours to finish all 12 hats I intend to make in this challenge and may even come with some chaffage.  Hopefully not.  I can't imagine yarn chaffage would be good.

Without further ado, let the race begin...
