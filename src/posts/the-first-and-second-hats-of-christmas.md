## For the First Hat of Christmas I truly crocheted for me... a quick and easy project under an oak tree...

The results are in, and I'm 1 for 2.  The peaked hat came out cute, and it was quick and easy:

[Ravelry Project notes](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/SiaTex/womens-peaked-cap):  Cute and quick hat. I had no problem with sizing. My natural tension fit the size of my head. I did have to redo the brim though. I assumed I would need to tighten up a bit, but that was clearly the wrong assumption as it made the brim curl and stick to my forehead rather than stick out like a real brim. Instead, I loosened up a bit more than natural and it came out fine. Love it!

## For the Second Hat of Christmas I truly crocheted for me... a felted fedora that I really do not love...

Yeah, so this originally came out more like a top hat until I manipulated it into a salvageable cowboy hat.  I was a little freaked out before the felting, but it shrank up fine after about an hour of agitation... talk about a workout!  I don't like the hat so much, but it was fun exploring felting, and I'm sure this won't be my last felting project.

[Ravelry Project Notes](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/SiaTex/fedora):  So, this was supposed to be a felted fedora. It originally came out more like a top hat, but I was able to manipulate the crown a bit to make it shorter and look more like a cowboy hat. It’s all different colors because I kept running out of yarn. So, it wasn’t the greatest project, but I do like how felting comes out so I might try felting out a bit more. The higher difficulty is only because of the work involved in agitating for a hard felt.
