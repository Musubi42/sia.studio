Want me to speak at one of your events? <a href="mailto:sia@clioandcalliope.com?subject=Speaking inquiry from sia.codes">Email me</a>, or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thegreengreek)!

## Testimonials

> Siaâ€™s workshop gave me the guidance and tools I needed to finally begin diagnosing real performance problems in my web applications. Not only did her course shed light on how to solve the issues I knew I had, but it also exposed problems I hadn't discovered yet. Whether youâ€™ve got an application thatâ€™s not performing well or if you just want to have a better grasp of the performance tools available, Siaâ€™s Measuring Web Performance workshop is well worth your time.
> --Aundra Miller, Software Engineer at http://Learning.com


> Sia was my instructor at Tech Talent South. Thanks to her I've been able to move forward in my career as a Software Developer. Her knowledge and endless patience for our questions created a foundation that I've been building on ever since. She is a fantastic teacher."
> --Ryan Hageman, Independent Software Developer
