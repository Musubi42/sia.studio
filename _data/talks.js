    description: "Help! My app bundle is 5MB! My users are angry that my app is so slow! It’s easy to forget that performance matters when we are under pressure to deliver features quickly. What data should we use to inform our decisions? From code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking to bundle analysis, progressive rendering, and modern transpiling, come learn how you can deliver a better experience to your users with high-performing front-end apps. This talk is library-agnostic (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)."

    description: 'Are you losing revenue to performance? 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load. Performance is important. Tooling can be hard. Do flame charts intimidate you? Come learn how to audit and fix common performance issues using Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, and webpagetest.org. In this hands-on workshop, we’ll learn about the most common performance pitfalls and fix latency, image, and JavaScript issues in a sample web application. You must understand HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and running npm scripts to get the most out of this workshop. Understanding webpack is helpful but not required.'

    title: 'Modern JavaScript for Modern Browsers',
    description: "Web performance matters. From SEO to bottom-line revenue impacts, performance can make or break your app. However, fixing performance feels like a quagmire of expert-level topics. What if I told you JavaScript bundle sizes could be cut up to 50% by doing one thing only? Nearly 90% of web traffic runs on modern browsers, but we're transpiling all of our JavaScript to ES5. That’s expensive. In this talk, we'll learn about differential serving, or serving both modern bundles and legacy bundles using webpack. This talk is framework agnostic, and best if you have at least a basic understanding of JavaScript."

Server-side rendering and code-splitting can drastically improve user experience by minimizing the work that the client has to do. It’s easy to get lost in the lingo, so come learn what it all means and how to easily build universal React apps using the Next.js framework. We’ll walk through the concepts and use code examples to cement your understanding. You’ll get the most out of this session if you’re comfortable with React and ES6 syntax.'

We will start by learning about the core fundamentals of Redux including pure functions, actions, reducers, the store, and subscriptions. Then we will integration Redux into a React app, learning about components vs containers, accessing the store, async actions, middleware, and thunks. Next, we will layer in React Router 4, learning about params, queries, and redirects; prompt before navigation, and scrollToTop. Time permitting and based on audience preferences, we can learn about using component libraries, styling, ES6+, and more! Basic knowledge of React is required for this workshop."

React is super fast, but you could be shooting yourself in the foot with design decisions. Come learn how to make your React apps lightning fast! Page abandonment increases with every second of load time.Also, profiling and debugging performance issues can seem like an overwhelming topic to learn.In this session, we’ll cover the usual suspects of performance issues, from the basics of using the correct build, to the fundamentals of immutable data, to higher- level tools like Perf, shouldComponentUpdate, PureComponent, and memoizing computed props in Redux. We will both cover the concepts and walk through examples step- by - step so that by the end of this session you will feel like a React Speed Racer.You’ll get the most out of this session if you’re at least comfortable with React and ES6 syntax."
